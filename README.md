# Colin-Taaffe-Portfolio
A portfolio to showcase my work as a developer.

## What I did to accomplish goals in this project
I used semantic HTML elements to define the structure of the webpage. I used anchor tags with a navigation bar to create clickable links that take you to different parts of the page upon click. I used CSS to create background images for each different section of the page. I used CSS to style the page with different fonts, font sizes, colors, background colors and much much more. I used CSS to create media querys for the purpose of making the page responsive on smaller devices.

## How I accomplished my goals with this project
I used semantic HTML elements to make the page accessible. I used different selectors in CSS to target certain HTML elements to make the page look stylish. I used media querys for the purpose of making the page more responsive on smaller devices.

In this screenshot you can see the navbar with our anchor tags, upon clicking an individual one they take you to that specific section of the page.

This screenshot shows the functionality of the anchor tag, the circled #about-me anchor tag and how it is connected to the actual About Me section using an id.

## Usage
There are 4 links in the nav bar at the top of the page, clicking one of them will have the UI take you to that specific area of the page. The coming soon image can be clicked and will take you to a page I worked on in a class mini-project. Clicking images in the sections will currently take you to Google.com as a placeholder until we do more projects in class. Clicking the resume image will take you to Google.com as well for now until I build my resume. Clicking items in the contact me section will do different things, the X one will take you to my X profile. The email one will pull open your own email and address a new email to my email address (used mailto). Hovering mouse over Phone# will reveal my phone number. Finally, clicking GitHub will take you to my GitHub profile.

## Roadmap
In the future I plan to continue adding to this portfolio with assignments we finish as the class goes on. I also plan on introducing JavaScript to the page and implementing other things as I learn them in class.
